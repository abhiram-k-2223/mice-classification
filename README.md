# Mice Classification Project

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify mice based on various features. The dataset used for this project is contained in the file `mice.csv`.

## Project Overview

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: 
   - The dataset is loaded and inspected.
   - Missing values are dropped.
   - Categorical features are one-hot encoded.
   - The target variable is label encoded.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The data is split into training and testing sets.
   - A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained on the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data.
   - The accuracy of the model is calculated and displayed.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```
## Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiram-k-2223/mice-classification.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
cd mice-classification
```bash
cd mice-classification
```
## Running the Code
After navigating to the project directory, you can run the code using a Jupyter notebook or any Python IDE. Make sure the dataset file mice.csv is in the same directory as your code.
